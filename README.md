In this study we use customers’ reviews from Takealot online store to determine if indeed customers receive poor service delivery. 
The study used Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine to classify the customer’s reviews and to check if whether those reviews are positive or negative. 
The Naïve Bayes classified more negative reviews than positive reviews which may indicate that indeed the customers are having a poor service, and the Naïve Bayes performed better than Support Vector Machine.
